# MyReads Project

Project submission for the first course, React Fundamentals, in Udacity's React Nanodegree programme.

The MyReads app allows its users to organise their collection of books into three shelves: _Currently Reading_,_Read_, and _Want To Read_. It also allows a user to search for more books, and add them to their collection, in the shelf they want.

Happy reading. :)

From the project directory in a terminal, run the following command in the given order:

- npm install

Browse to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
